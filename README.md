I will start by saying I have written small programs for companies I have worked with in the past from 1997 using Visual basic 4,5 and 6.
My last meagre project was in 2013 using visual studio 10. This was another small project to scan and store application forms to the network folder which was a great program and I think the company is still using it with no update to that project.

I want to understand IOS / Android development. I have been watching YouTube videos for the last six months trying to understand where to start. All the videos I watched all failed to show how you link an APP to your local database like SQL or a IIS API to pull / push the data.

I don't have a particular project in mind as I type this assignment.
I have a WhatsApp group that share Pokémon go code and chat. Now I want to extend that concept into an app where users can use the app to share code and chat to each other and raid with each other.

This repository is my documenting repository for learning the world of App Development. I started this journey to understand App Development April 2022 and I plan to run to June Month End on spending two hour a day including weekends to get a foundational knowledge across a lot of different areas that make up AppDEV incluse Swift, Xcode Java. My two main Programming tools are Xcode and VSCode.
