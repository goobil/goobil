I will start by say in have write small programs for company i have work with since 1997 using Visual basic 4,5 and 6.
My last meager project was in 2013 using visual studio 10 this was a another small program to scan and store the documents to a network folder which was a great program and i think the company still using it with no update to that project.

I want to start understand APP building on the IOS platform. i have been watching YouTube videos for the last six months trying to understand where to start. All the video i watch all failed to show how you link an APP to your local data base like SQL or a IIS API to pull the data.

I don't have a particular project in mind as i type the assignment.
I have a WhatsApp group that share Pokémon go code and chat. Now i wan to extend that concept into am app where users can used the app to share code and chat to each other and raid with each other.
