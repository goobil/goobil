I want to understand iOS/Android development. I have been watching YouTube videos for the last six months trying to understand where to start. All the videos I watched all failed to show how you link an APP to your local database like SQL or an IIS API to pull or push the data.

I don't have a particular project in mind as I type this assignment.
I have a WhatsApp group that shares Pokémon Go codes and chats. Now I want to extend that concept into an app where users can use the app to share code, chat with each other, and raid with each other.

This repository is my documentation repository for learning the world of app development. I started this journey to understand App Development in April 2022, and I plan to run to June Month End on spending two hours a day, including weekends, to get foundational knowledge across a lot of different areas that make up AppDEV, including Swift, Xcode, and Java. My two main programming tools are Xcode and VSCode.
