📱 App Development Learning Journey & VoteUpp Project
Welcome to my documentation repository—created to chronicle my exploration into mobile app development and the evolution of my first real-world project: VoteUpp.
🎯 Purpose
I began this journey in April 2022 with a simple goal: to understand how mobile apps are built, especially how they connect to local databases like SQL or APIs hosted on IIS. After months of watching tutorials, I realized many skipped over the practical steps of linking an app to real data sources. This repository is my attempt to fill in those gaps through hands-on learning and structured documentation.
💡 Early Inspiration
While I didn’t start with a specific app idea, I was part of a WhatsApp group that shared Pokémon Go codes and coordinated raids. That sparked a concept:
What if there was an app where users could share codes, chat, and raid together—all in one place?
That idea planted the seed for future experimentation and eventually led to VoteUpp.
🗳️ VoteUpp: My First Real-World App
VoteUpp is a mobile app I’m building for the United Progressive Party to boost engagement and gather strategic feedback from supporters. It’s designed to be:
🗳️ Interactive – Users can participate in polls and share opinions.
📣 Community-driven – Encourages dialogue and collaboration.
📱 Accessible – Built with inclusive design and semantic labeling.
🧠 Well-documented – Includes onboarding guides and markdown documentation for maintainability.
This project is where I apply everything I’ve learned—from Flutter setup and push notifications to branding, asset optimization, and legal clarity.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
To build foundational knowledge, I committed to studying two hours a day (including weekends) until the end of June 2024. My focus areas included:
Languages & Frameworks: Swift, Java, Flutter
Development Tools: Xcode, VSCode
Topics Explored: App architecture, database integration, API communication, UI/UX fundamentals
📚 What You'll Find Here
This repo contains:
✅ Notes and insights from tutorials and experiments
🧩 Code snippets and mini-projects
📄 Markdown documentation (README.md, CONFIG.md, FLAVORS.md, etc.)
🧠 Reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and what I plan to explore next
🗂️ Assets and branding materials for VoteUpp
